# IT Subcommittee

## Overview
The IT Subcommittee is responsible for building and maintaining the foundational infrastructure for the Smart Campus Management System (SCMS). This includes setting up secure and scalable cloud environments, provisioning relational databases, managing internal networks, and implementing system monitoring tools to ensure high reliability and performance.

## Goals
1. **Cloud Infrastructure**:
   - Host SCMS components on a secure, scalable cloud platform (AWS, Azure, or GCP).
   - Ensure high availability with load balancers and auto-scaling.

2. **Database Management**:
   - Provision and optimize PostgreSQL or MySQL databases for data storage.
   - Automate backup and recovery processes.

3. **Network Management**:
   - Establish secure networks with firewalls, VPNs, and network segmentation.
   - Monitor and visualize network performance using tools like Grafana.

4. **System Monitoring**:
   - Implement real-time monitoring dashboards for system health.
   - Configure alerts for critical system failures or anomalies.

## Key Projects
1. **CloudSetup**:
   - Set up virtual machines, load balancers, and VPNs in the cloud environment.
2. **DatabaseProvisioning**:
   - Install and configure a relational database for structured data.
   - Automate database backups and validate recovery workflows.
3. **NetworkManagement**:
   - Configure firewalls and segment networks to isolate sensitive resources.
   - Deploy tools like Prometheus for monitoring and visualization.
