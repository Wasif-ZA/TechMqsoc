Here’s the **IT Subcommittee Guidelines** document modeled after the detailed structure of the Cybersecurity Guidelines. It includes clear expectations, coding standards, collaboration points, and best practices.

### **IT Subcommittee Guidelines**

## Purpose
These guidelines provide a framework for the IT Subcommittee to execute its responsibilities effectively and ensure that the infrastructure of the Smart Campus Management System (SCMS) supports its functionality, scalability, and security. The subcommittee's work lays the foundation for all other technical subcommittees.

---

## General Principles
1. **Infrastructure First**:
   - Prioritize setting up secure, reliable, and scalable infrastructure to support all system components.
   - Document all configurations to ensure reproducibility and future upgrades.

2. **Collaboration-Driven**:
   - Work closely with Cybersecurity, Software Engineering, and Commerce subcommittees to address infrastructure-related needs.
   - Regularly communicate progress, challenges, and resource requirements.

3. **Automation and Monitoring**:
   - Leverage automation tools to reduce manual effort and ensure consistency.
   - Implement system monitoring for real-time insights into infrastructure health.

## Standards and Guidelines

### **1. Cloud Infrastructure**
- Use cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) for scalable hosting solutions.
- Configure virtual private networks (VPNs) to secure internal communication.
- Ensure high availability by setting up load balancers and failover mechanisms.
- Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation to standardize deployments.

### **2. Database Management**
- Choose a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL) for structured data.
- Enable daily automated backups and validate recovery procedures monthly.
- Optimize database queries by setting up appropriate indexes and analyzing query plans.

### **3. Network Management**
- Use firewalls to restrict unauthorized access to servers and APIs.
- Implement network segmentation to isolate critical resources (e.g., databases).
- Use monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana to visualize network and server performance.

---

## Collaboration Guidelines

### **1. Cybersecurity Subcommittee**
- **TLS Implementation**:
   - Work with Cybersecurity to install and maintain TLS certificates for all endpoints.
   - Enable HTTPS for all APIs and dashboards.
- **Firewall Rules**:
   - Implement Cybersecurity’s requirements for firewall configurations to block unauthorized traffic.
- **Monitoring Tools**:
   - Provide infrastructure for deploying Snort or other intrusion detection systems.

### **2. Software Engineering Subcommittee**
- **Database Access**:
   - Set up secure database connections (e.g., PostgreSQL credentials, connection pooling).
   - Share database schemas and ensure compatibility with backend APIs.
- **Deployment Support**:
   - Assist with hosting backend and frontend applications in a secure cloud environment.

### **3. Commerce Subcommittee**
- **Financial Dashboard Hosting**:
   - Ensure financial dashboards are hosted securely and optimized for performance.
- **Data Backup**:
   - Automate backup schedules for financial records and reports.

## Best Practices
1. **Documentation**:
   - Maintain clear documentation for all configurations (e.g., server setup, database schemas, and network topology) in `/docs`.

2. **Scalability**:
   - Plan infrastructure to handle at least 10x the current load for future expansion.
   - Use autoscaling policies for cloud resources to optimize cost and performance.

3. **Redundancy and Disaster Recovery**:
   - Set up redundant systems for critical components (e.g., databases, APIs).
   - Periodically test failover mechanisms to ensure reliability during outages.

4. **Resource Optimization**:
   - Monitor resource usage and optimize costs using cloud provider tools (e.g., AWS Cost Explorer).
   - Right-size instances and services to match the workload.

---

## Security Standards
1. **Access Control**:
   - Use role-based access control (RBAC) for administrative access to servers and databases.
   - Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all administrative accounts.

2. **Data Protection**:
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit using AES-256 and TLS.
   - Limit access to production databases to authorized personnel only.

3. **System Patching**:
   - Regularly update operating systems, software dependencies, and cloud services to patch vulnerabilities.

---

## Monitoring and Alerts
1. **Health Monitoring**:
   - Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and CloudWatch to monitor system uptime, CPU usage, memory, and disk space.
2. **Alerting Mechanisms**:
   - Set up alerts for critical issues such as server outages, high latency, or unusual traffic patterns.
3. **Log Analysis**:
   - Use centralized logging tools (e.g., ELK Stack) to analyze logs for anomalies and generate actionable insights.

- [ ] TLS certificates installed and HTTPS enabled for all endpoints.
- [ ] Database provisioned and connected to APIs securely.
- [ ] Firewall rules configured and tested for unauthorized access.
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards set up for real-time system insights.
- [ ] Automated backup and recovery processes tested.

---

## Expectations for Members
- Contribute to tasks based on assigned responsibilities, including setting up servers, configuring databases, or managing networks.
- Follow these guidelines to ensure the infrastructure meets the highest standards.
- Actively communicate progress and raise any roadblocks during subcommittee meetings.
