# Software Engineering Subcommittee Guidelines

## Purpose
To define the standards, best practices, and collaboration points for designing and implementing the application logic of the Smart Campus Management System (SCMS) using modern tools and frameworks such as **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Supabase**, and **GraphQL**.

---

## General Principles

### **1. Modular and Scalable Design**
- Use **Next.js** for server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) to improve performance and scalability.
- Apply Tailwind CSS for highly customizable and efficient styling.
- Build reusable and modular components to ensure maintainability.

### **2. API-Centric Approach**
- Use **GraphQL** to enable flexible, efficient data fetching and minimize over-fetching or under-fetching.
- Ensure that all APIs are well-documented and versioned.

### **3. Test-Driven Development (TDD)**
- Write tests for both frontend and backend components.
- Use tools like **Jest** or **React Testing Library** for frontend tests and **Postman/Newman** for GraphQL API testing.

---

## Coding Standards

### **1. Frontend Development**
- Use **Next.js** for building the frontend:
  - Server-side rendering (SSR) for dynamic content.
  - Static site generation (SSG) for faster page loads where applicable.
- Styling with **Tailwind CSS**:
  - Maintain a consistent design system using reusable classes.
  - Use utility-first CSS for faster styling and better performance.

### **2. Backend Development**
- Use **Supabase** as the backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform:
  - Leverage its built-in database (PostgreSQL) for storing data.
  - Use Supabase authentication for secure user access.
- Design APIs with **GraphQL**:
  - Create flexible query endpoints that allow clients to request only the data they need.
  - Use strong type definitions to ensure query validation and error handling.

### **3. State Management**
- For global state management, use built-in React hooks or libraries like **Zustand** or **Redux Toolkit** if needed.

---

## Collaboration Guidelines

### **1. IT Subcommittee**
- **Database Integration**:
  - Collaborate on connecting Supabase to the SCMS database.
  - Test database queries to ensure data consistency.
- **Hosting and Deployment**:
  - Work together to deploy the Next.js app using platforms like Vercel or Supabase hosting.

### **2. Cybersecurity Subcommittee**
- **Authentication**:
  - Integrate Supabase authentication (OAuth 2.0) with secure token management.
- **API Security**:
  - Ensure GraphQL endpoints are protected from injection attacks and unauthorized access.

### **3. Commerce Subcommittee**
- **Data Visualization**:
  - Build responsive financial dashboards using Tailwind CSS.
  - Integrate GraphQL APIs to fetch and display commerce-related data efficiently.

## Best Practices

1. **Version Control**:
   - Use Git for version control with a feature-branch workflow.
   - Require peer reviews before merging to the main branch.

2. **Code Documentation**:
   - Document APIs using tools like **GraphQL Playground** or **Apollo Explorer**.
   - Maintain frontend documentation for components using Storybook.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Handle errors gracefully in the frontend using React error boundaries.
   - Log backend errors in Supabase for debugging and resolution.

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Optimize GraphQL queries to reduce data fetching overhead.
   - Use Next.js Image Optimization for efficient image delivery.
