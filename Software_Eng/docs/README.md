## Goals
1. **Frontend Development**:
   - Develop responsive and accessible web interfaces using Next.js.
   - Create a consistent design system with Tailwind CSS.
   - Implement key features such as room booking, dashboards, and attendance tracking.

2. **Backend Development**:
   - Leverage Supabase for database provisioning, authentication, and backend management.
   - Use GraphQL APIs to provide flexible and efficient data access for the frontend.

3. **API Integration**:
   - Ensure seamless interaction between frontend, backend, and database layers.
   - Test and optimize GraphQL queries for performance and reliability.
