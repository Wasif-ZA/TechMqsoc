# Scoping Document: [Project Name]

## Purpose
[State the purpose of the project and its scope within the Cybersecurity Subcommittee.]

---

## Scope

### **In-Scope Tasks**
- [List tasks explicitly covered by the project, e.g., implementing OAuth 2.0.]
- [Include integration points, e.g., encrypting API responses.]

### **Out-of-Scope Tasks**
- [List tasks that are not covered, e.g., front-end implementation.]

---

## Key Responsibilities
1. [Define core responsibilities, e.g., configuring Snort for intrusion detection.]
2. [Specify individual roles, e.g., team member A focuses on encryption.]

---

## Integration Points
