## Timeline
| **Milestone**             | **Task**                          | **Due Date** |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------|
| Initial Setup             | [E.g., Configure development environment] | Week X       |

## Dependencies
- **IT Subcommittee**: [State what is required, e.g., server setup or TLS certificates.]
- **Software Engineering Subcommittee**: [Detail API integration or encryption support.]
- **Commerce Subcommittee**: [Mention any financial data or dashboards involved.]

---

## Key Metrics for Success
1. [Define measurable outcomes, e.g., at least 90% of simulated attacks detected.]
2. [Specify completion criteria, e.g., all sensitive data encrypted with AES-256.]

---

## Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk**: [E.g., Delayed server configuration from IT.]
  - **Mitigation**: [E.g., Communicate deadlines clearly and have backup test servers.]
- **Risk**: [E.g., API integration issues.]
  - **Mitigation**: [E.g., Regular check-ins with Software Engineering.]
